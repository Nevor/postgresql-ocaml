2006-11-08:  Upgraded prompt_gtk to LablGTK2.

             Tightened compilation warnings.

             Removed superfluous linking option.

             Replaced obsolete escaping method, and added calls to
             PQfreemem required on Windows.

2006-09-15:  Updated OCamlMakefile.

2006-08-17:  Automatically fetch compiler and linker flags for the local
             PostgreSQL-installation for simpler installation.  Thanks to
             Vincenzo Ciancia <ciancia@di.unipi.it> for the hint!

2006-07-21:  Fixed GC-bug.

2006-06-08:  Fixed GC-bugs.

2006-01-24:  Added support for accessing binary fields.

2005-05-31:  Fixed some uncleanliness reported by Saffire (an FFI-type
             checker).

2005-03-22:  Small internal improvement.

2004-12-28:  Fixed a potential compilation problem.

2004-12-20:  Fixed a bug in the "escape_bytea"-function: escaped strings
             contained an additional null character.

             Thanks to Christophe Troestler
             <Christophe.Troestler@umh.ac.be> for the bug report!

             Updated OCamlMakefile.

2004-08-26:  Small internal code-improvement.

2004-08-05:  Several significant improvements: the oid type is now
             revealed as int in the interface.  The "ftype"-method has
             been changed to return the new type "ftype".  The latter
             lists 60 constructors, which specify the types of fields.

             The change comes with new conversion functions:

               * ftype_of_oid
               * oid_of_ftype
               * string_of_ftype
               * ftype_of_string

             And with new exceptions:

               * exception Oid of oid
               * exception InternalError of string

2004-08-02:  Fixed two serious thread-related bugs.

2004-07-14:  Minor update for OCaml-3.08.

             Updated OCamlMakefile.

2004-07-06:  Added an example "cursor" that demonstrates the use of
             cursors.

2004-06-29:  Fixed an off-by-one error in method "get_all_lst".
             Thanks to Anil Madhavapeddy <anil@recoil.org> for the patch!

             Updated OCamlMakefile.

2004-04-27:  Updated OCamlMakefile.

2004-04-13:  Fixed a problem concerning backwards compatibility with
             older OCaml-versions that do not yet use the caml-namespace
             (identifiers not yet prefixed with "caml_").

2004-02-21:  Added CAMLprim in the C-interface where appropriate.

2004-02-08:  Fixed minor bugs concerning returning unit values from C.
             Made C-interface compile with pedantic compiler settings.

2004-01-29:  Some major changes to interface to use or improve handling
             of default arguments. Effected methods:

               * escape_string
               * escape_bytea
               * getline
               * getline_async
               * putnbytes
               * lo_write
               * lo_read
               * lo_seek

             Removed methods (obsolete due to default arguments - use
             "lo_write" instead):

               * lo_write_string

             Added functions:

               * unescape_bytea

2004-01-28:  First release.
